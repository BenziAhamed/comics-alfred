Comics is a workflow for the productivy app Alfred (version 2). It shows a list of installed comics plugins from which you choose one, and you can read a comic straight off of Alfred.

Comics is designed to be easily extendible, and new comics (apart from the ones that come default with the workflow) can be added to it.

Comics was originall posted in the [Alfred Forums](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/1217-comic-strip-viewer-workflow/).

You can download the latest version of the extension [here](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2377432/alfredv2/comics/Comics.alfredworkflow).
